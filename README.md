## The types of potatoes

### Pink ![pink_potato](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/5673e41e3ad4bf15afb47ca7a488251fa656c071.png)
#### Speedy!
These powered potatoes make you zoom through the world!
### Blue ![blue_potato](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/cd42e0803cc79ea63d59f758ad4f8d916c9e47b0.png)
#### Bouncy!
Ever wanted to scale your builds? This powered potato will help you jump to success!
### Orange ![orange_potato](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/df5be8d37613826f5cf53f1d8c0a71e5ba58353f.png)
#### Slippery!
Slippery. You may slide if you stand on it... but it also makes your pickaxe slip through blocks hastily (gives haste)! 
Great source of fuel due to the immense power slowly slipping away!
### Purple ![purple_potato](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/b590420e9a6d655542e92f001a3c7b0b1b055594.png)
#### Bright Light-y? Luminosity!
Lights up your world and your eyes too, with night vision sneaking up on mobs will be easier than ever!

### These warp into each other when placed on the Potato Portal!
